# web-scraper
I created this web scraper project as both an opportunity to learn and gain new experience, and as a way to help someone who needed specific data in CSV format.

It is designed to work on one specific website which has a public database of thousands of businesses alongside all their public information.

The script uses beautiful soup to parse the web page content and selenium as the web driver that directs the flow of control.
